      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Olympia, WA and moved to Portland, OR after graduating from Willamette University. I studied art history in college and transitioned my research skills into a marketing job post-college. As I got more experience working, I started to think about my skills, how I like to work, and making a career change that would better align with how I can best use and grow my skills. Coding was recommended by several friends, so I decided to enroll in classes to learn more.</p>
      <h2>Here are some of my favorite things:</h2>

        <p>Lucy is my 2 year old Golden Retriever. She's probably one of the moodiest dogs that I've ever met. Like all pet owners, I could talk about my girl forever.</p>
